<h1>Hello World Demo</h1>

EMOS Framework is a simple yet powerful environment for development of automated 
WinRunner&reg; tests. This package contains the "Hello World" demo which is an 
example project that is normaly used as a starting point for (completely) new
projects. 
 
<h2> Getting Started</h2> 
<ul>
<li>Make sure EMOS Framework is installed in <code>&lt;wrun_install_dir&gt;\lib\EMOS_GPL</code> 
directory (if not you will have to adjust paths in <code>Scripts\startup</code> script.</li>
<li>Set the <code>Scripts\startup</code> as WinRunner startup script and re-start 
WinRunner.</li>
<li>Run the <code>Scripts\kickoff_new_style</code> script in ineractive mode. 
Don't worry about the dialog stating that the script is read-only. Everything in 
EMOS Framework is read-only because we keep our files under version control. If 
you want to change the code, then make <code>script</code> file writable (and 
don't worry about warnings that <code>database</code> could not be saved).</li>
<ol>
    <li>Press OK at the dialog mentioning <code>"testset:1"</code>.</li>
    <li>A dialog saying "Hello World!" should appear.</li>
    <li>Continue and check the test results after script finished.</li>
    <li>Open and analyse <code>Data\suite1.xls</code> file.</li>
    <li>Open and analyse <code>Data\table1.xls</code> file.</li>
    <li>Open and analyse <code>Scripts\LIB\FRM\frm_lib1_lib</code> script.</li>
    <li>Open and analyse <code>Scripts\DRV\drv1_lib</code> script.</li>
    <li>Check the <code>kickoff_new_style</code> script that you've just run to 
        see how all got started</li>
    <li>That's it. Now you should try <code>FlightDemo</code> example.</li>
</ol>
