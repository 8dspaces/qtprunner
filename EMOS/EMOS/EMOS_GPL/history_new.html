<h1>EMOS Framework SourceForge History</h1>
This document contains the (incomplete) list of changes that were made on EMOS Framework
since it was published on SourceForge. For history on previous versions follow
the link to <a href="history_old.html">"old history"</a>.
<ul>
<li><a href="#1.4.2">What's new in Release: 1.4.2</a></li>

<h3><a name="1.4.2"></a>What's new in Release: 1.4.2</h3>
<a href="#top"><font size="-2">top</font></a>
<ul>
<li><b>Integration with TTracX logging tool</b></li>
<p></p>
As of version 1.4.2 EMOS Framework is ready for integration with TTracX logging tool.
If everything works fine, then nobody should feel any change. In other words,
users of WrLog should still be able to run WrLog without noticing anything. 
The same should apply to users that use no logging :-( If this is not the case, 
please let us know.
<p></p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>EVAL instruction improved</b></li>
<p></p>
EVAL instruction used to parse the given string and execute each individual 
command between semicolons individually. This was causing problems with embeded 
semicolons. For example the following EVAL instruction would not work as expected:
<pre>
    EVAL~print("before;after")
</pre>
The new logic now executes the complete expression with a single <code>eval()</code>.
For this reason you can run can run anything that <code>eval</code> can run, e.g.
<pre>
    EVAL~print("you can;");print(";do this now");print("\nbut be careful!")
</pre>
If you want EMOS Framework to evaluate the return code of the executed command,
then you should assign the return code to public variable <code>__evalRC</code>
which is already allocated by EMOS Framework. For example:
<pre>
    EVAL~__evalRC=some_function()
</pre>
If you don't do this, EMOS Framework has no idea whether you EVAL suceeded
or not (and will allways mark it as "passed" in test results.
<p></p>
Affected files:
<ul><li>emos_frm_stp_lib</li></ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>New substitution keyword &lt;&amp;...&amp;&gt; added</b></li>
<p></p>
To substitute the output of an arbitrary <code>eval</code> statement into an
Excel cell you can now use the &lt;&amp;...&amp;&gt; construction. For example
if you embed the folowing instruction into an Excel cell EMOS Framework would 
use current date/time (as returned by time_str())as test data:
<pre>
    &lt;&amp;time_str()&amp;&gt;
</pre>
Note that you should only use single commands which return some value because the
underlying code that is invoked looks like this:
<pre>
    eval( "__evalRC = " & your_command & ";" );
</pre>
Affected files:
<ul><li>emos_frm_lib</li></ul>
</ul>
