<h1>EMOS Framework Core</h1>

EMOS Framework is a simple yet powerful environment for development of automated 
WinRunner&reg; tests. This package contains the core libraries required to run
system.
<h2> Getting Started</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>To get EMOS Framework started you need to load the libraries from this
package. You will normally do this from the startup script in your WinRunner project.
All you need to do is to set the search path to this directory and to call the
"emosint" test. This test will load all libraries that are needed by EMOS
Framework. You can see an example of such startup test in "Hello World" example.</li>
<li>There is an (mostly incomplete) <a href="history_new.html">history</a> document 
with changes that were made on each version. To see what's new in this release
check the top link in this document.</li>
<li>There is an old <a href="doc/webhelp/index.htm">User's Guide</a> (or something 
that was once intended to serve that purpose). Although this document is a bit
outdated you should still read it because all main concepts still apply.</li>
<li>There is also an <a href="doc/api-doc/index.html">API documentation</a> for the 
EMOS_GPL package. Although you don't need to know much about it it is not a bad
idea to get acquainted with core libriaries such as <code>emos_frm_lib</code>, 
<code>emos_frm_gui_lib</code> and <code>emos_frm_stp_lib</code>.</li>
<li>To start with EMOS Framework you should download the <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/emos-framework/HelloWorldDemo_v1_4_2.zip?download">
"Hello World"</a> example and follow the instructions in <code>readme.html</code>. 
Note that we used to call this project "TPL" because it usually serves as a template 
for new projects. In fact, you can still find it under <code>EMOS_GPL/FRM/TPL</code>.</li>
